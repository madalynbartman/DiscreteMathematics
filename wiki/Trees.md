# Definitions
### Tree: T
A connected graph, without any cycles, made of nodes with one being a root. Tree has a shortest path between two arbitrary nodes.
### Node
A vertex in a graph
### Root
The starting node, usually at the top of the tree
### Parent Node
A node that exists a level above an arbitrary node
### Child Node
A node that exists a level below an arbitrary node
### Sibling Node
A node that has a same parent node as that of an arbitrary node
### Leaf Node
A node that has no child node
### Interior Node
A node that is neither a root node nor a leaf node
### Ancestor Node
All nodes that are included in the path from the root node to an arbitrary node
### Descendant Node
All nodes that are included in the path from an arbitrary node to a leaf node
### Degree
Number of child nodes an arbitrary node has

# Binary Tree
A tree with max degree of 2

### Complete Binary Tree
A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible 
### Full Binary Tree
A tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children

### Skewed Binary Tree
A type of binary tree in which all the nodes have only either one child or no child
