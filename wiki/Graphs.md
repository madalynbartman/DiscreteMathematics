# Definitions
### Graph: G = (V, E)
A graph is made of a set with Nodes(Vertices) and another set with Edges which connects Nodes.
### Adjacent, Incident
when nodes U and V are connected with an edge E, nodes U and V are **Adjacent** and E is **Incident** to U and V
### Loop
An edge with only one incident node. 
### Multi-Graph
when there's more than one edge between two nodes.
### Directed Graph: G = <V, E>
Edges are represented as arrows with directions.

### Weighted Graph: W = [u,v]
Edges contain weights
### Degree: d(v)
number of incident edges to node v.

For directed graphs:

out degree: edges going outwards a node.

in degree: edges coming towards a node.

# Types
### Subgraph
includes only partial nodes and partial edges
### Spanning Graph
all nodes but only partial edges

### Isomorphic Graph
Two graphs which contain the same number of graph vertices connected in the same way are said to be isomorphic

### Planar Graph
A graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints. In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other

### Complete Graph
for all n nodes in a graph, each node should have n - 1 edges

### Bipartite Graph
a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets and such that every edge connects a vertex in to one in
