## Algorithm
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations

## Features of an Algorithm
* Input
* Output
* Correctness
* Finiteness
* Effectiveness
* Generality
* Definiteness

## Complexity: O(n)

Time Complexity: time required for the program to execute

Space Complexity: memory space required for the program to execute
## General rule

constant < log < linear < nlogn < quadratic < cubic < exponential

## Examples
Find the complexity for each function

**f(n) = 3 + 1/2n**

f(n) = O(1)

**f(n) = n^3 + 2n**

f(n) = O(n^3)

**f(n) = logn + nlogn**

f(n) = O(nlogn)
