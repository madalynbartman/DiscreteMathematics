# Types of Inference
## Valid Inference
When both hypothesis and conclusion(s) are all **True**

## Invalid Inference 
When the hypothesis is **True** but at least one of the conclusions is **False**

All the conclusions are true when both propositions in the hypothesis are true. 

Therefore, this is a **valid infernece**

One of the conclusions are false even though it's propositions are true. 

Therefore, this is an **invalid inference**
