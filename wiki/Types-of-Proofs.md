# Existence Proof
Proving the proposition by providing a True example

### Examples
**1. For some real numbers x, y prove x^2 > y^2 if x > y**

Equation is true for x = 2 and y = -1. 

Therefore, the proposition is True for some real numbers.

**2. For some real number a, prove that (a+1)^2 >= a^2**

Equation is true for a = 3.

Therefore, the proposition is True for some real numbers.

# Proof by Counter-Example
Proving the proposition by providing a False example

### Examples
**1. For all real numbers x, y prove x^2 > y^2 if x > y**

Equation is false for x = 0 and y = -1. 

Therefore, the proposition is not True for all real numbers.

**2. For all real number a, prove that (a+1)^2 >= a^2**

Equation is false for a = -1.

Therefore, the proposition is not True for all real numbers.
