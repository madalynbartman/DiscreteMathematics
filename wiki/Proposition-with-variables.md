# Propositional Function: P(x)
A sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of true or false, except that within the sentence there is a variable (x) that is not defined or specified, which leaves the statement undetermined. (According to Wikipedia)

## Domain of Discourse: D
Scope of values for the variable included in a propositional function

### Examples
**P(x): x^2 -3x = 0 Determine the truth values for P(1) and P(3)**

P(1): -2 ≠ 0 False

P(3): 0 = 0 True

**Q(x,y): x = 2y Determine the truth values for Q(1,2) and Q(2,1)**

Q(1,2): 1 ≠ 4 False
Q(2,1): 2 =2 True

# Quantifiers
## Universal Quantifier: ∀
All values included in the Domain of Disclose(D) for propositional function. P(x): ∀x P(x)

### Examples
When Domain of Disclose(D) is Integers(Z), find the truth values for the propositional functions.

**P(x): x is a real number**

∀x P(x): for every integer x, x is a real number. True

**P(x): x is a natural number**

∀x P(x): for every integer x, x is a natural number. False

**P(x): x is an imaginary number**

∀x P(x): for every integer x, x is an imaginary number. False

## Existential Quantifier: ∃
At least one value included in the Domain of Disclose(D) for propositional function. P(x): ∃x P(x)

### Examples
When Domain of Disclose(D) is Integers(Z), find the truth values for the propositional functions.

**P(x): x is a real number**

∃x P(x): there exists an integer x such that x is a real number. True

**P(x): x is a natural number**

∃x P(x): there exists an integer x such that x is a natural. True

**P(x): x is an imaginary number**

∃x P(x): there exists an integer x such that x is an imaginary number. False
